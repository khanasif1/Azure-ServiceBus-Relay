# Azure-ServiceBus-Relay
The Azure Relay service enables you to securely expose services that run in your corporate network to the public cloud.
WCF Relay works with the full .NET Framework and for WCF. You create a connection between your on-premises service and 
the relay service using a suite of WCF "relay" bindings. The relay bindings map to new transport binding elements designed to
create WCF channel components that integrate with Service Bus in the cloud. For more information, see getting started with WCF Relay.
